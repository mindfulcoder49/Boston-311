Therefore I have created a github repository and structured the code as a python package that can be installed with pip.\n","\n","This will greatly simplify our Jupyter notebooks going forward.\n","\n","I will probably still use Jupyter notebooks to develop the code so I can keep track of my thought process and make it easier to create presentations. The github repository will always have the most up to date tools and code."],"metadata":{"id":"P1BXqsllgueC"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##Questions and To-Dos:\n","\n","Below is our open questions and to-dos consolidated from the last notebook. Moving forward we will probably keep this list at the top of each notebook.\n","\n","2. Add more features\n","3. clean up the data by removing outliers\n","6. look at the currently available android app and see what values are available to the user to select, and which categories might be assigned by the 311 agents after receiving a new case.\n","7. compare a basic model which only uses the department value as a feature to our more complex models as a heuristic for whether additional features actually improve predictions.\n","8. Moving forward compare our model predictions with the target date assigned by 311 to see which performs better.\n","\n","Questions to answer:\n","1. Can we find some basic commonality between open cases?\n","2. When and how is the target date set? How about the overdue flag?\n","3. Do cases autoclose after a certain time?\n","\n","###Conclusions from this notebook, copied from below:\n","We have a problem now though, which is that our data cleaning functions drop the case_enquiry_id before returning the data, which is good for training, but it means we can't match up prediction results with the original cases. \n","\n","Our immediate next task for prediction should be to refactor the data cleaning and splitting functions to make predicting cases possible with a particular model.\n","\n","###Conclusions from Boston311_v8:\n","\n","We got some variable results on these models. Now that we have several scenarios, we might want to come up with ways to compare the performance of these models easily.\n","\n","We are reaching the limits of the capabilities of Google Colaboratory. When we train our models, we might want to try deleting the test data after splitting it so we can save ram. If we want to save it we can write it to a file and download it before deleting it.\n","\n","Additionally, we want to delete any intermediary data frames created during training before doing the next training. The best way to do that will be to put our data splitting and training inside functions so when the functions complete the variables go out of scope and the RAM they used is freed. Anything that needs to be kept can be saved to files.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"di-BA9wzlip8"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##Install the package from github using
