This led to a model that had a much higher loss value on the validation set than the training set, which is in contrast to our previous model that had a lower loss value for the validation set than the training set. \n","\n","Another method we could use with the linear regression model is assume that all open cases might be closed tomorrow, and assign them a time to close based on that.\n","\n","For the logistic regression model, we have two important factors:\n","1. We need to make sure we are not training or validating our model on the cases we want to predict, i.e. the recently opened cases that still have a chance of being closed within the near future. \n","2. We can try predictin whether a case will be closed within a certain amount of time, rather than just closed at any point. Basically we can try what we did on the linear regression model in the last notebook and do it for our logistic regression model.\n","\n","Lastly, the last notebook crashed a few times due to RAM requirements.
