With the addition of scenarios to our data cleaning functions, and the recent refactoring our of data cleaning functions, we can't be certain that there aren't some nonobvious bugs that have been introduced in the code and are impacting our machine learning models.\n","\n","We therefore have come to the point where writing unit tests is not optional. Ideally we would have been writing unit tests from the beginning, but hopefully you can forgive me for putting that off for a bit in my first project. I was trying to let the demands of a machine learning project reveal themselves organically, and it didn't take too long for these doubts in the accuracy of my own data to drive unit tests to the top of my priorities."],"metadata":{"id":"BQ225_Wy-niT"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Below is our open questions and to-dos consolidated from the last notebook.

Add more features\n","3. clean up the data by removing outliers\n","6. look at the currently available android app and see what values are available to the user to select, and which categories might be assigned by the 311 agents after receiving a new case.\n","7. compare a basic model which only uses the department value as a feature to our more complex models as a heuristic for whether additional features actually improve predictions.\n","8. Moving forward compare our model predictions with the target date assigned by 311 to see which performs better.\n","\n","Questions to answer:\n","1. Can we find some basic commonality between open cases?\n","2. When and how is the target date set? How about the overdue flag?\n","3.

I had already been considering removing any cases that were employee generated. From some ad hoc case inspection, it looks like the public works department uses this database to track filling in potholes even if they haven't been reported by a constituent. That information would probably not be relevant to a model that's supposed to predict how long it takes to address constituent concerns. \n","\n","Lastly, it might be worth considering dropping cases that are closed too soon after being opened, since our model might be most useful for predicting how long it takes to close a case that doesn't have a quick resolution.\n","\n","These considerations can lead to new scenarios for model training to compare to previous ones."],"metadata":{"id":"R7xdGwOZrlTM"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import re\n","import tensorflow as tf\n","import glob\n","from tensorflow import keras\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, f1_score\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n","from datetime import datetime\n","\n","from IPython.display import display\n","\n","%matplotlib inline\n","\n","#first of course we must import the necessary modules"],"metadata":{"id":"1ex4nrsttjQW","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1683772481131,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":13462,"user":{"displayName":"Alex Alcivar","userId":"16433380480796576336"}}},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Let's add some code to load the records directly from their storage so we don't have to upload them to google colaboratory each time.
