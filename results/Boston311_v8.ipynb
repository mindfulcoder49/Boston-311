We also did a small amount of data analysis that led us to some ideas for more data cleaning scenarios:\n","\n","There are 212 unique results for the type column, which is a lot, but not that many for our 2 million cases. This might be a defining and predictive categorical variable worth including as a feature.\n","\n","All but one case with a negative survival time was generated by a city worker or an employee. From some ad hoc case inspection, it looks like the public works department uses this database to track filling in potholes even if they haven't been reported by a constituent. That information would probably not be relevant to a model that's supposed to predict how long it takes to address constituent concerns. \n","\n","Lastly, it might be worth considering dropping cases that are closed too soon after being opened, since our model might be most useful for predicting how long it takes to close a case that doesn't have a quick resolution.\n","\n","These considerations can lead to new scenarios for model training to compare to previous ones.\n","\n","Additionally, it might be nice to refactor the scenario functionality to accept a list of integers and separate the data cleaning options so that they can be combined in different ways more easily."],"metadata":{"id":"BQ225_Wy-niT"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Below is our open questions and to-dos consolidated from the last notebook.

Moving forward compare our model predictions with the target date assigned by 311 to see which performs better.\n","\n","Questions to answer:\n","1. Can we find some basic commonality between open cases?\n","2. When and how is the target date set? How about the overdue flag?\n","3.

Now that we have several scenarios, we might want to come up with ways to compare the performance of these models easily.\n","\n","We are reaching the limits of the capabilities of Google Colaboratory. When we train our models, we might want to try deleting the test data after splitting it so we can save ram. If we want to save it we can write it to a file and download it before deleting it.\n","\n","Additionally, we want to delete any intermediary data frames created during training before doing the next training. The best way to do that will be to put our data splitting and training inside functions so when the functions complete the variables go out of scope and the RAM they used is freed.
