They are unstructured and unfocused, and create a few problems for us:\n","\n","1. Our feature matrix changes depending on our input data set. This is because one-hot-encoding categorical variables creates a different set of feature columns depending on the categories included.\n","\n","2. The scenarios are hard coded, and hard to remember. It might be better to have an intuitive way to specify our scenarios.\n","\n","3. Our data loading automatically loads all of the data from all of the years. It might be useful to be able to specify years. It might be even more useful to be able to specify a range of datetimes\n","\n","4. Our data cleaning and splitting are together, and drop the case_enquiry_id, our unique case identifier, so we can't easily match our prediction with our original data records. \n","\n","Problems 1 and 4 in particular leads to sticky challenges. If we want to make predictions with a model on data from the last month, we need to clean and split it with the entire dataset, hoping that no new categories have been added in the last month for any of the categorical value columns we are one-hot-encoding, and then we can't match the results easily back to our original data.\n","\n","What changes can we make to fix these problems with our pipeline?\n","\n","From my research, it looks like scikit-learn has a whole set of modules to handle these pipeline problems, and a mature and experienced data scientist could probably solve this problem quickly using those tools. However, in the interests of preserving the work I've done so far and not getting stuck wrestling with high level scikit-learn modules, let's do this the hard way. This will also let us keep an eye on RAM usage since that's a problem for us on the limite resources of Google Colab.\n","\n","Let's create a class 'Boston311Model' that keeps track of the parameters of our training. It will have properties:\n","\n","model - our model once trained\n","feature_columns - a list of our feature columns\n","feature_dict - a dictionary with the keys being the names of our feature columns and the values being lists of all the possible values\n","train_date_range - a dict with keys \"start\" and \"end\" and datetime values\n","predict_date_range - a dict with keys \"start\" and \"end\" and datetime values\n","scenario - our scenario data, maybe a list, maybe a dict, depending on how we recode our scenarios\n","model_type - Our type of model, linear, logistic, etc\n","\n","The functions will be:\n","When you create the object, you will specify the feature_columns, the model type, the scenario, the train_date_range, and the predict_date_range\n","\n","load_data() - this will use the start_date and end_date. It will return a dataframe\n","\n","enhance_data( data ) - this will enhance the data according to our needs\n","\n","clean_data() - this will drop any columns not in feature_columns, create the feature_dict, and one-hot encode the training data\n","\n","split_data( data ) - this takes data that is ready for training and splits it into an id series, a feature matrix, and a label series\n","\n","train_model( X, y) - this trains the model and returns the model object\n","\n","clean_data_for_prediction( data ) - this will drop any columns not in feature_columns, and one hot encode the training data for prediction with the model by using the feature_columns and feature_dict to ensure the cleaned data is in the correct format for prediction with this model.\n","\n","predict() - this will load the data based on the predict_date_range, call clean_data_for_prediction, call split data, use the model to predict the label, then use the id series to join the predictions with the original data, returning a data frame."],"metadata":{"id":"P1BXqsllgueC"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##Questions and To-Dos:\n","\n","Below is our open questions and to-dos consolidated from the last notebook. Moving forward we will probably keep this list at the top of each notebook.\n","\n","2. Add more features\n","3. clean up the data by removing outliers\n","6. look at the currently available android app and see what values are available to the user to select, and which categories might be assigned by the 311 agents after receiving a new case.\n","7. compare a basic model which only uses the department value as a feature to our more complex models as a heuristic for whether additional features actually improve predictions.\n","8. Moving forward compare our model predictions with the target date assigned by 311 to see which performs better.\n","\n","Questions to answer:\n","1. Can we find some basic commonality between open cases?\n","2. When and how is the target date set? How about the overdue flag?\n","3. Do cases autoclose after a certain time?\n","\n","###Conclusions from Boston311_v9, copied from below:\n","We have a problem now though, which is that our data cleaning functions drop the case_enquiry_id before returning the data, which is good for training, but it means we can't match up prediction results with the original cases. \n","\n","Our immediate next task for prediction should be to refactor the data cleaning and splitting functions to make predicting cases possible with a particular model.\n","\n","###Conclusions from Boston311_v8:\n","\n","We got some variable results on these models. Now that we have several scenarios, we might want to come up with ways to compare the performance of these models easily.\n","\n","We are reaching the limits of the capabilities of Google Colaboratory. When we train our models, we might want to try deleting the test data after splitting it so we can save ram. If we want to save it we can write it to a file and download it before deleting it.\n","\n","Additionally, we want to delete any intermediary data frames created during training before doing the next training. The best way to do that will be to put our data splitting and training inside functions so when the functions complete the variables go out of scope and the RAM they used is freed. Anything that needs to be kept can be saved to files.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"di-BA9wzlip8"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##Install the package from github using
